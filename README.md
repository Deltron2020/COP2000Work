This repository contains book assignments, modules, and homework I completed for the class <i>Introduction to Programming in C++.</i> I took this course back in 2020 while pursuing my BS in IT Management and Cybersecurity. This material is to be used as a learning resource, and a personal refresher if I ever need to dive back into C++.
